		<h3>About</h3>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">
		The Game of Life</a> is a 2D cellular automaton created by
		John Conway in 1970. Although it's referred to as a "game", it
		is not a game in the traditional sense; there are no players, and
		the state of the game depends on solely its previous state. Each
		square in the grid is referred to as a "cell", surrounded by the
		eight "neighbor" cells adjacent to it. Each cell is either alive 
		(black) or dead (white). The game follows four basic rules:</p>
		<em><p>Any alive cell that has fewer than two neighbors will die, as if by underpopulation.</p></em>
		<em><p>Any alive cell that has two or three neighbors will remain alive.</p></em>
		<em><p>Any alive cell that has more than three neighbors will die, as if by overpopulation.</p></em>
		<em><p>Any dead cell that has exactly three neighbors will come to life, as if by reproduction.</p></em>
		<p>Despite its simple rules, the game allows for complex behaviors, and
		the computaional power of a

		as become immensely popular with computer scientists and mathematicians.</p>
